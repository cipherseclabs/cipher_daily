  <h3 style="color:darkblue;"><b>Threat Actors</b></h3>
  <ul>
    <li>WarLock ransomware group – newly emerged actor (since mid‑2025) claiming responsibility for the Colt attack, offering one million documents (financial, employee, contracts, architecture) for $200K.<a href="https://www.techradar.com/pro/security/colt-forced-to-take-services-offline-following-apparent-cyberattack" target="_blank">Source: https://www.techradar.com/pro/security/colt-forced-to-take-services-offline-following-apparent-cyberattack</a> <a href="https://www.scworld.com/brief/colt-telecom-investigating-warlock-ransomware-claims" target="_blank">Source: https://www.scworld.com/brief/colt-telecom-investigating-warlock-ransomware-claims</a></li>
  </ul>

  <h3 style="color:darkblue;"><b>Analyst Comments / Defender Impact Summary</b></h3>
  <p>• WarLock’s exploitation of SharePoint (CVE‑2025‑53770) demonstrates the risks tied to delayed patch management on external-facing services.</p>
  <p>• The Kerberos zero-day (CVE‑2025‑53779) could result in full domain compromise—patch immediately.</p>
  <p>• Telecom systems’ downtime increases operational risk and customer trust loss; defense-in-depth and segmentation are key.</p>
